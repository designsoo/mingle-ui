## Usage

### Using with react-hook-form
To use InputField with react-hook-form, follow the example below:

```ts
import { FormProvider, useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { InputField, PrimaryButton } from "mingle-ui";

function LoginPage() {
  const methods = useForm({
    mode: 'all',
  });

  const onSubmit = (data) => {console.log(data)};

  return (
    <FormProvider {...methods}>
      <form onSubmit={methods.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        <InputField
          formMethod={methods}
          name='email'
          type='email'
          placeholder='Email'
          label='Email'
          errorMessage='Email is Required'
          isRequired
        />
        <InputField
          formMethod={methods}
          name='password'
          type='password'
          placeholder='Password'
          label='Password'
          errorMessage='Password is Required'
          isRequired
        />
        <PrimaryButton>Login</PrimaryButton>
      </form>
    </FormProvider>
